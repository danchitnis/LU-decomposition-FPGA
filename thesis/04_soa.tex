\chapter*{Statement of Achievement}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Statement of Achievement}

This is a brief statement outlining what you yourself (as opposed to your
supervisor, technical staff, team members if you were working in a team, etc.)
contributed to the project and what you yourself achieved. The statement need
not be more than a couple of paragraphs and should certainly not take up more
than one side of A4.
