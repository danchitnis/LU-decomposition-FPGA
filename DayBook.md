- Learn something about the memory allocation in C++.

Typically, all memory needs were determined before program execution by defining the variables needed. Therefore, it is not recommended to use dynamic array, although some compiler like *gcc* allows the dynamic array initialization.

In C, we usually use ==malloc== to allocate memory. However, in C++, ==new== and ==delete== are used.

```cpp
int *a;
a = new int[10];
```

## Dynamic 2D array
Although dynamic array is not allowed, C++11 allows the below initialization if the row length is a compile time constant.

```cpp
auto arr2d = new int [nrows][CONSTANT];
```

If not, we can use the code below, which creates an array of pointers to arrays to allow 2D syntax like contiguous 2D arrays.
```cpp
int** a = new int*[rowCount];
for(int i = 0; i < rowCount; ++i)
    a[i] = new int[colCount];
```

Although this method gives us the desired indexing syntax, it is doubly inefficient: big and slow both in space and time. It creates a dynamic array of pointers, then initializing each pointer to its own, independent dynamic array. Each "row" in the matrix is a separately allocated dynamic array. Making a heap allocation is expensive both in time and space. The allocator takes time to make the allocation, sometimes running O(n) algorithms to do it. And the allocator "pads" each of your row arrays with extra bytes for bookkeeping and alignment. That extra space costs...well...extra space. The deallocator will also take extra time when you go to deallocate the matrix, painstakingly free-ing up each individual row allocation.

The better solution is to allocate your whole matrix as a single dynamic array, then use (slightly) clever indexing math of your own to access cells.

```cpp
class Matrix
{
    int *array;
    int m_width;

public:
    Matrix(int w, int h) : m_width(w), array(new int[w * h]) {}
    ~Matrix() { delete[] array; }
    int at(int y, int x) const { return array[index(y, x)]; }
    void set(int t, int y, int x) { array[index(y, x)] = t; }
    int getwidth() { return m_width; }
    void display()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < m_width; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < m_width; j++)
                cout << array[index(i, j)] << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

protected:
    int index(int y, int x) const { return x + m_width * y; }
};
```

## Time in C++
The chrono library, a flexible collection of types that track time with varying degrees of precision.

```cpp
#include <chrono>

std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point begin = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point end = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();

std::cout << "Time difference = " << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - begin).count() << "[Âµs]" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Time difference = " << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds> (end - begin).count() << "[ns]" << std::endl;
```
Class std::chrono::steady_clock represents a monotonic clock. The time points of this clock cannot decrease as physical time moves forward and the time between ticks of this clock is constant. This clock is not related to wall clock time (for example, it can be time since last reboot), and is **most suitable for measuring intervals**.
