Brief description of project: This project aims to accelerate the solving of linear systems by parallelizing the matrix decomposition on FPGAs. Solving large linear systems is part of everyday engineering design, including the integrated circuit simulation, where the majority of the matrices are sparse. Lowerâ€“upper (LU) decomposition is the most commonly used method to solve the sparse linear system. However, the sparse-matrix decomposition is hard to parallelize on regular processors due to the irregular structure of the input matrices. Modern FPGAs have the potential to compute these hard-to-parallelize problems more efficiently due to their reconfigurable structure, such as flexible memory access, loop flattening and unrolling. As a result, these FPGA implementations may lead to higher compute throughput and efficiency.
